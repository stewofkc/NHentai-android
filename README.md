## Suspension of maintenance

Due to time and some reasons, this project was suspended for maintenance. I am very sorry for the inconvenience! Here I recommend another similar application: [EhViewer](https://github.com/seven332/EhViewer), which has more powerful features and stability, is also currently ongoing maintenance.

## Screenshots

Screenshots are out-of-dated. We will update it soon.

## Introduction

### For users

This application develops on Material Design guidance. It provides a beautiful and friendly UI. Maybe it's the most beautiful doujinshi client.

**NHBooks uses NHentai.net's API. The sites may contain NSFW contents. Please pay attention to whether it is applicable to local laws and regulations.**

### For developers

Since NHBooks 2.0, we make a refactor for it. Now it uses Kotlin + Android Databinding + Room + MVVM Structure.

BTW, We try using Kotlin coroutine instead of popular async handle library (like RxJava, AsyncTask). Although it's a experimental function, it works fine.

## Build environment

This project was built successfully with these tools:

- Kotlin 1.2.0 Support
- Android Studio 3.0 / IntelliJ IDEA 2017.3 (Untested)
- Android SDK Platform 27
- Gradle 4.3
